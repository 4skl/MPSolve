## Trying to make a POC of the solve language method using python nltk  


### Copilot help  

Can I do a lazy search using python nltk ? The idea is to define a language and check if the set defined by an expression is equivalent to the set of another expression but staying lazy.. Anyways how can I fix this code ?

How can I be sure that TMS -> T if S is only T ?
